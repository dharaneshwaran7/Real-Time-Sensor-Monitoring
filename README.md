# Real-Time-Sensor-Monitoring
Real-Time Sensor Monitoring with NodeMCU and Web Interface

#### **Overview**  
This project uses a **NodeMCU ESP8266** microcontroller to monitor data from multiple sensors in real-time. The collected data is displayed on a web interface, making it accessible via a smartphone or web browser. The project is designed to provide real-time feedback for applications involving vibration analysis, distance measurement, and voltage monitoring.

#### **Sensors and Functionalities**  
1. **ADXL345 Accelerometer**  
   - Measures vibration speed and intensity.  
2. **Ultrasonic Sensors (x2)**  
   - Measures distances for two separate directions.  
3. **Piezoelectric Sensor**  
   - Monitors voltage output generated by vibrations.

#### **Features**  
- Displays sensor data (distance, vibration, and voltage) on a web interface.  
- Auto-refresh feature updates data every second.  
- Manual refresh option via a button on the web page.  
- Simple and lightweight code for easy integration and deployment.

#### **How to Set Up**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git  
   ```  

2. **Open in Arduino IDE**:  
   - Navigate to `src/main.ino` and open it in the Arduino IDE.  

3. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   - `ESP8266WiFi`  
   - `Wire`  

4. **Set Wi-Fi Credentials**:  
   - Edit the following lines in the code to match your network:  
     ```cpp  
     const char* ssid = "YourWiFiSSID";  
     const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";  
     ```  

5. **Upload the Code**:  
   - Connect your NodeMCU and upload the code via the Arduino IDE.  

6. **Access the Web Interface**:  
   - Open the Serial Monitor to get the IP address of the NodeMCU.  
   - Enter the IP address in your browser to view the real-time data.
